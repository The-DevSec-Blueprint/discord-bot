# Pull Request (PR) Rules - The Herald Bot

## Introduction

The **DevSec Blueprint (DSB)** community is dedicated to educating members about **DevSecOps** principles, tools, and best practices. As part of our commitment to maintaining high-quality software development, **The Herald** Discord bot follows structured **Pull Request (PR) guidelines** to ensure clarity, maintainability, and consistency across contributions.

This document outlines the **Conventional Commits** specification for PR titles, ensuring that contributions align with **best DevSecOps practices**, facilitate automated release generation, and maintain a structured commit history.

## PR Title Formatting

Every **non-draft PR** must follow the **Conventional Commits** specification for PR titles. This ensures:

- **Consistent and readable commit history**
- **Automatic generation of release notes**
- **Avoidance of merge conflicts in release documentation**

### PR Title Format

A PR title should follow this structure:

```
<type>([optional scope]): <description>
```

Where:

- **`<type>`** â€“ Defines the nature of the change (see **Types** below)
- **`[optional scope]`** â€“ Provides additional context (optional but recommended)
- **`<description>`** â€“ Brief and meaningful description of the change

## PR Types

Each PR must fall under one of the following types:

| Type         | Description                                                                                |

- **Keep descriptions clear and concise:** Avoid unnecessary details in the title; add further context in the PR description.
- **Follow best security practices:** Any security-related PRs should be labeled accordingly and reviewed carefully before merging.
